This is a Python project that I use to derive finite difference equations
for solutions of the full Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. The tool
produced simply tracks the derivation steps and makes sure the rules are
followed, and no terms are left out or signs flipped! Why did I write this?
Don't ask!

..	note::

    This tool is not intended to do most of what *SymPy* can do. The human
    operator is supposed to know what he/she is doing. It simply helps
    eliminate silly mistakes!
