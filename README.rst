This is a Python-Qt6 project that I use to derive finite difference equations for solutions ot the full Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. The tool produced simply tracks the derivation steps and makes sure the rules are followed, and not terms are left out or signs flipped! Why did I write this? Don't ask!

..	note::

	This tool is not intended to do most of what *SymPy* can do. The human operator is supposed to know what he/she is doing. It simply helps eliminate silly mistakes!
