Matter

I was born in Washington, D.C. some time after the Earth had cooled. At the age
of about three, my next door neighbor took me to the Smithsonian Institute
museums on the National Mall where I saw my first airplane:

My guide was Andy Tarapchak, a World War II B-26 bombrt pilot who survived over 70 missions over France and Germany. He told me countless stories about his very scary adventures flying during those missions, and explained a lot about all of the aviation-related displays we saw.

There were all kinds of things on display in the SMithsonian, and we explored all of them. As I grew up, I got to the point where I could get to the museums by myself, riding the bus. I think I knew every square foot of the public areas, and quite a few of the non public areas as well. (Kids are too short to see those "not allowed past this point" signs!)

Long before I sat in my first classroom I discovered that "stuff" I could see in the museum was made up of other "stuff" I could not see. The museum displays showed me what that hidden other "stuff" was and how it made the visible "stuff" work. What I did not know at the time was that these displays were turning me into a scientist - someone who wanted to understand how things worked *inside*. I also did not know how deep I would end up going in my quest to figure out how things worked in the world we live in!
The hidden stuff was made up of still deeper more hidden stuff that had to be figured out. Where does this even end -- or does it?

We have to stop looking deeper and deeper somewhere, or else we will all end up physicists who cannot stop digging deeper!
